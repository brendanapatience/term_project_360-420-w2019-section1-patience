# Data

Place any data that you generate, or data that you rely on for validation, in this folder.

Make sure to provide descriptions to each file in this *README* file.


FILE DESCRIPTIONS

"euler energy vs time"
This file takes the mechanical energy data of the simulation when Euler's method is being
used. The left column is the mechanical energy in joules, the right column is the time in seconds

"runge-kutta energy vs time"
This file is the same as the as the "euler energy vs time" file except that it only changes when
running the simulation using Runge-Kutta as the ODE solver
